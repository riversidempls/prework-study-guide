# Prework Studyguide Webpage

## Description

I created this webpage as an exercise to prepare for the U of MN College of Continuing Education Coding Bootcamp in August 2022. There were four main goals of the prework exercise. 

    1) Introduction to HTML
    2) Introduction to CSS
    3) Introduction to Git and GitHub
    4) Introduction to JavaScript

By completeing these exercises I became familiar with working in VSCode and also commiting changes in GitBash and pulling those into the main repository stored in GitHub.

## Usage

The prework studyguide can be used to document any details that are important to remember for you as a student in web development. As I continue learning more about these four topics, I can add notes here that I'd like to remember. I learned that you can open the Web Developer console in the browser using CTRL-Shift-I and then access some details written back to the console log using JavaScript functions. Reloading the page displays a random topic to study in the console.
